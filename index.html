    <p> I am currently working at SYEP as a student who is learning to code.</p>
    <p>Backstory: I was born in Manhattan December 11th, 2008. I was born in the presbyterian hospital where my loving mother named me Jeremy. Then, my mother, my siblings and I moved to the Bronx and I had good luck from my mother because my mother had an apartment when I was born, Because she lived in the shelter for 3 years. And then I lived in the Bronx for almost 6 years, after that, Our apartment was on fire so we moved back to the shelter. After a while, My mother and I moved to Yonkers NY. The schools in New York were good, I made a lot of friends and so did my mother, but my mother couldn’t find a job. My Grandmother died in 2019, and we all were grieving at that time. So We moved back to the Bronx, My mother put me in a school that was close to where I was. But then, the pandemic hit and thank God that nobody in my family died. Later, in 2021, My mother got me tickets to Puerto Rico, San Juan. And I loved it there, the food was delicious and the beaches were beautiful and A sight that’s marvelous to the eye. However, I couldn’t go to the Dominican Republic because my Father didn’t sign the papers for my passport. So my mother now is planning for me to go to the Dominican Republic by having my Father sign the passport papers. I love my mother and everything she has done for me, and I wouldn’t have been alive talking about this if it wasn’t for her bravery and intelligence. And Last year I worked for SYEP as a 9th grader, so I’m returning to the Job this year in hopes to make some money. And I thank God for giving me and my Mother the life we have today.</p>
